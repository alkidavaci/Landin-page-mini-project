           <h3> Well I'da done better,</h3><br> but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
Now what? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! You don't know how to do any of those. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

One hundred dollars. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. It must be wonderful. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Kids have names?

You don't know how to do any of those.
Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?
It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Bender?! You stole the atom.
This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open yougitr mercy file!
Well, then good news! It's a suppository. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! We're rescuing ya. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. File not found. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Shut up and get to the point! You're going to do his laundry? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

Tell them I hate them. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! You are the last hope of the universe. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Your best is an idiot! Can we have Bender Burgers again? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

I don't want to be rescued. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Bender, we're trying our best. Why did you bring us here? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. No, just a regular mistake. Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender?! You stole the atom. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
